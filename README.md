# google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push

Google Cloud Tasks Push queue emulation for arbitrary destination URLs (if you need it, you know).

At the time of writing, Google Cloud Tasks Push queues can only target App Engine URLs. This tool is a workaround to
allow the use of Cloud Tasks to target arbitrary URLs. A 'queue pump'. This is done by:

 * Your code enqueuing a task in a specific format to a special pull queue. The task includes the target URL details.
 * This tool polls the pull queue.
 * This tool sends the HTTP request to the target URL.
 * As per App Engine Push queue semantics, a 2xx response to the HTTP request results in task completion, and anything
   else (including request failure) results in the task staying in the queue for later retry.

**TAKE NOTE**

App Engine Push queue HTTP requests arrive with project admin authentication. This allows requests and future retries to
be 'indefinitely authenticated'. There is no such mechanic here. E.g. if you add a task with an Authorization header
that contains a token valid for one hour, and that task fails to complete within an hour for whatever reason, that task
will now permanently fail to authenticate, and is effectively stuck in the queue (requires manual deletion).

Be sure to monitor your task queue and logs.


## Installation

### Helm

There is a chart to install the Docker Hub image and map CLI args to Helm values. See the `helm` directory.

### Docker

There is an image on Docker Hub called `tclift/google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push`. A minimal run is:

    docker run tclift/google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push --project my-project

### Binary only

See [Buildingâ†’Binary](#binary).


## Usage

### Local Test Example

 1. Create a push queue called `pull-to-push`. Use `queue.yaml` / `queue.xml` if you use it, or:

        gcloud alpha tasks queues create-pull-queue pull-to-push

 2. Enqueue a test task (see [Pull Queue Task Format](#pull-queue-task-format) for format details):

        gcloud alpha tasks create-pull-task \
          --queue=pull-to-push \
          --payload-content="{\
            \"method\":\"POST\",\
            \"absUrl\":\"http://localhost:8000/\",\
            \"headers\":{\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"},\
            \"payload\":\"{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}\"\
            }"

 3. Run a local web server to receive the request. E.g. using
    [local-web-server](https://github.com/lwsjs/local-web-server):

        ws

 4. Run the tool. The only required option is `project` (GCP project id):

        google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push --project my-project

 5. Output from the tool should show processing of a task, and the web server should show receipt of the request. If the
    tool indicates failure to connect to the pull queue due to permissions, see
    [GCP Authentication](#gcp-authentication).

### Pull Queue Task Format

This is the content of the 'outer' pull task. The wrapped push task is encoded in the `payload` value.

| Key     | Type   | Purpose                                       |
|---------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| method  | string | HTTP method, uppercase.                       |
| absUrl  | string | Absolute URL for push task endpoint.          |
| headers | Object | Headers to include in the request, e.g. auth. |
| payload | string | Request body of the push task.                |

E.g.:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "absUrl": "https://example.org/endpoint",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "payload": "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"
}
```

### GCP Authentication

When using
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#providing_credentials_to_your_application),
no additional options are required.

When running in the Docker image locally on a system with `gcloud`, the ADC can be mounted into the image like:

    gcloud auth application-default login

    docker run --rm -it \
      -v ~/.config/gcloud:/.config/gcloud \
      tclift/google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push \
      --project my-project

Alternatively, [create a new service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) with the
*Cloud Tasks Enqueuer* and *Cloud Tasks Dequeuer* roles. Point to the JSON credentials file using the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. E.g.:

    docker run --rm -it \
      -v $(pwd)/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials.json" \
      tclift/google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push \
      --project my-project

### Queue Backoff

There are two sets of queue backoff settings - one for the pull queue, and one for push (making the HTTP requests).

The pull backoff settings apply when there are no tasks in the queue. This is to prevent polling too often during
periods of inactivity, but more backoff means more latency handling tasks.

The push backoff settings apply to failed HTTP requests (non-2xx response). This is to prevent wasting resources trying
the same task when it continually fails. Note that failing tasks are never deleted by this utility; they will continue
retrying at the max push backoff rate.

The backoff parameters are modelled on the App Engine queue settings. See
[the docs there](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks) for more detail.

### Other Options

See the command help

    google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push --help


## Building

### Binary

To build a Linux AMD64 static binary:

    ./gradlew build

Or, for a specific platform, e.g. macOS:

    ./gradlew build -PtargetPlatform=darwin-amd64

### Docker image

The image contains this tool's binary and a root cert store (for making HTTPS requests).

    docker build -t google-cloud-tasks-pull-to-push .
